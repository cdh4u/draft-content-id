1.  Introduction

1.1.  Identifying a body part

   A SIP message consists of a start-line, one or more header fields, an
   empty line indicating the end of the header fields, and an optional
   message-body, as specified in [RFC3261].

   The message-body of the SIP message can be a non-multipart body or a
   multipart body as specified in [RFC3261].

   A multipart body contains zero, one or several body parts, encoded
   using [RFC2045] format.

   A body part in the multipart body can contain a Content-ID header
   field with an ID value uniquely identifying the body part, as
   specified in [RFC2045].

   There is no defined method how to convey an ID value uniquely
   identifying the non-multipart body.  The Content-ID header field is
   not a defined SIP header field and the non-multipart body is not a
   body part.

1.2.  Referencing a body part

   A SIP header field can contain a reference to a body part using a
   Content-ID URL, as specified in [RFC5621].

   The Content-ID URL is specified in [RFC2392].  [RFC2392] also
   specifies how to discover the body part referenced by a Content-ID
   URL.

   Examples of a SIP header field referencing a body part using a
   Content-ID URL are:

   o  [RFC6442] specifies how a Geolocation header field references a
      body part using a Content-ID URL, for providing location.
   o  [RFC5368] specifies how a Refer-To header field references a body
      part using a Content-ID URL, to provide a list of targets.

1.3.  Problem statement

   Since the Content-ID header field is not a defined SIP header field
   and since non-multipart body is not a body part:

   o  When solely one content needs to be transported in a SIP message,
      if a UAC does not need to include in the SIP message a SIP header
      field referencing a body part containing the content, then the UAC
      can set the message-body to a non-multiparty body containing the
      content.
   o  However, when solely one content needs to be transported in a SIP
      message, if a UAC needs to include in the SIP message a SIP header
      field referencing a body part containing the content, then the UAC
      needs to set the message-body to a multiparty body with one body
      part such that the body part contains the content and associated
      Content-ID header field.

1.4.  Examples of the problem

1.4.1.  Example 1

   If a UAC sends an INVITE request conveying location as specified in
   [RFC6442], if the UAC decides not to include an SDP offer, and if the
   location is conveyed by value, then the UAC needs to include only one
   content in the INVITE request.

   This content contains the location information and can be e.g. of the
   application/pidf+xml MIME type.

   However, due to [RFC6442] requiring inclusion of a Geolocation header
   field referencing the body part with the content containing the

Internet-Draft              Content-ID in SIP                 April 2017


   location information, the UAC needs to set the message-body of the
   INVITE request to a multipart body, and the UAC needs to include a
   body part with a content of the application/pidf+xml MIME type and
   with an associated Content-ID header field in the multipart body.

1.4.2.  Example 2

   If a UAC sends an REFER request including a list of targets as
   specified in [RFC5368], then the UAC needs to include only one
   content in the REFER request.

   This content contains the list of targets and is of the application/
   resource-lists+xml MIME type.

   However, due to [RFC5368] requiring inclusion of a Refer-To header
   field referencing the body part containing the list of targets, the
   UAC needs to set the message-body of the REFER request to a multipart
   body, and the UAC needs to include a body part with a content of the
   application/resource-lists+xml MIME type and with an associated
   Content-ID header field in the multipart body.

1.5.  Solution

   The Content-ID header field included in the header fields of a SIP
   message identifies a body part consisting of the message-body of a
   SIP message and metadata provided by some additional SIP header
   fields.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Content-ID header field

3.1.  Introduction

   This section defines the usage of the Content-ID header field for
   SIP.

3.2.  Syntax

   The ABNF for the Content-ID header fields is:

Internet-Draft              Content-ID in SIP                 April 2017


      Content-ID = "Content-ID" HCOLON msg-id

      msg-id     = "<" id-left "@" id-right ">"

      NOTE: id-left and id-right are specified in [RFC5322].

      NOTE: When used in a SIP header field, the msg-id syntax has been
      simplified compared to the syntax in [RFC5322].


3.3.  Semantics

   The Content-ID header field included in the header fields of a SIP
   message identifies a body part consisting of the message-body of the
   SIP message, and the metadata provided by:

   o  the Content-ID header field itself;
   o  a MIME-Version header field, if included in the header fields of
      the SIP message;
   o  a Content-Disposition header field, if included in the header
      fields of the SIP message;
   o  a Content-Encoding header field, if included in the header fields
      of the SIP message;
   o  a Content-Language header field, if included in the header fields
      of the SIP message;
   o  a Content-Length header field, if included in the header fields of
      the SIP message; and
   o  a Content-Type header field, if included in the header fields of
      the SIP message.

   The Content-ID header field can be included in any SIP message which
   is allowed to contain a message-body.

3.4.  Procedures

3.4.1.  UA procedures

   A UA MAY include a Content-ID header field in any SIP message which
   is allowed to contain a message-body.

   A UA MUST NOT include a Content-ID header field in any SIP message
   which is not allowed to contain a message-body.

   The UA MUST set the value of the Content-ID header field to a
   globally unique value.

Internet-Draft              Content-ID in SIP                 April 2017


3.4.2.  Proxy procedures

   A proxy MUST NOT add a Content-ID header field in a SIP message.

   A proxy MUST NOT modify a Content-ID header field included in a SIP
   message.

   A proxy MUST NOT delete a Content-ID header field from a SIP message.

4.  Security considerations

   The Content-ID header field value MUST NOT reveal sensitive user
   information.

   If the message-body associated with the Content-ID header field
   contains encrypted content, it MUST NOT be possible to derive a key
   that can be used to decrypt the message-body content from the
   Content-ID header field value.

5.  IANA considerations

   This specification registers a new SIP header field according to the
   procedures in [RFC3261].
